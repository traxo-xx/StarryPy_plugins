# Plugins:

## [slitherrr's IRC plugin](https://github.com/StarryPy/StarryPy_plugins/tree/master/plugins/irc_plugin)
> This plugin will connect to the specified server and join the specified target (if it's a channel), and echo messages to that target.
>
> Note that it currently doesn't support multiple channels, but doing so is fairly trivial and it'll probably be added soon.
### Add the following block to your config file:

>```
"irc": {
            "auto_activate": false,
            "bot_nickname": "StarryPy",
            "channel": "!!REPLACE ME!!",
            "echo_from_channel": true,
            "nickserv_password": "!!REPLACE ME!!",
            "port": 6667,
            "server": "irc.freenet.org",
            "color": "^#495449;"
        },
>```


## [SloanReynolds /who on login](https://github.com/MrMarvin/StarryPy_plugins/blob/master/plugins/loginwho_plugin)
> Displays a /who upon login

## [FZFalzar's BetterWhisper plugin](https://github.com/FZFalzar/StarryPy_plugins/tree/brutus_whisper/plugins/brutus_whisper)
> Brings better functionality for the sending of Private Messages in Starbound
> Adds the following commands and abilities to the server:
>```
@permissions(UserLevels.GUEST)
/w <name> <message> 			#Sends a PM to target. Overrides default /w functionality. alias is /whisper
/r <message>      				#Replies to the last person who you received a PM from
@permissions(UserLevels.ADMIN)
/socialspy <on|true|off|false>	#Enables/Disables SocialSpy, a feature for admins to receive PMs sent by anyone, for policing purposes
>```

## [FZFalzar's /afk plugin](https://github.com/FZFalzar/StarryPy_plugins/tree/afk_plugin/plugins/afk_plugin)
> Simple plugin that allows players to set their status via /afk.
> Player will be automatically unmarked from AFK if they chat or interact with any entity (doors, chests etc).
> Currently does not allow auto-afk or un-afk upon player movement due to API deficiency.
>```
@permissions(UserLevels.GUEST)
/afk							#Enables/disables AFK status
>```

> ### Add the following block to your config file:

>```
"afk_plugin": {
    "afk_msg": "is now AFK",
    "afkreturn_msg": "has returned",
	"auto_activate": true
    }
>```

## [Maffi's uptime plugin](https://github.com/MrMarvin/StarryPy_plugins/blob/master/plugins/uptime)
> Very simple plugin that responds to /uptime with the time StarryPy is running.

## [teihoo's /me emote plugin](https://github.com/StarryPy/StarryPy_plugins/tree/master/plugins/emotes)
> Very simple plugin that adds /me <emote> command to StarryPy.

## [teihoo's /starteritems plugin](https://github.com/StarryPy/StarryPy_plugins/tree/master/plugins/starteritems)
> Adds /starteritems command which can be used once per player and will give player a set of predefined starter items
> It is ment to work along with new_player_greeter_plugin, and will give a different set, that's why:

> ### Add the following block to your config file:

>```
"starteritems_plugin": {
    "auto_activate": true,
    "items": [
    [ "coalore", 100 ],
    [ "money", 1000 ]
    ],
    "message": "You were given a set of starter items ;)"
  }
>```

## [teihoo's /players plugin](https://github.com/StarryPy/StarryPy_plugins/tree/master/plugins/players)
> Very simple plugin that adds /players command, which is an alias for the existing /who command, to StarryPy.

## [teihoo's bookmarks plugin](https://github.com/StarryPy/StarryPy_plugins/tree/master/plugins/bookmarks)
> Adds the following commands and abilities to the server:
> ```
@permissions(UserLevels.GUEST)  #everything works for all users
/bookmark <name>  #creates a personal bookmark of the planet (need to be on planet)
/goto <name>      #moves ship to the bookmarked planet (need to be on ship)
/remove <name>    #removes a bookmark (need to be on planet)
> ```

## [mdeneen's Pushover plugin](https://github.com/StarryPy/StarryPy_plugins/tree/master/plugins/pushover_plugin)
> This adds basic support for [Pushover](https://pushover.net) messages. Right now it can:

> - Send a pushover message to a mobile device whenever a player joins
> - Avoid sending notifications for ignored players.
> Pushover supports delivery groups, so one could send messages to multiple users. This can be useful when running a private server so that you know when other players are online.

> ### Add the following block to your config file:

> ```
"pushover_plugin": {
    "api_key": "MY_API_KEY",
    "ignored_players":
        "Player1",
    ],
    "user_key": "MY_USER_KEY"
}
>```

## [Maffi's planet visitor announcer](https://github.com/StarryPy/StarryPy_plugins/tree/master/plugins/planet_visitor_announcer)
> Sends a message to every player on the planet whenever another player warps down onto it.

## [Hexicube's Planet Warps for StarryPy](https://github.com/MrMarvin/StarryPy_plugins/blob/master/plugins/hexicube_planet_warps_for_starrypy.py)

> Currently it conflicts with /warp from warpy because really that should be called /tp due to what it does. If you want to use this with warpy at the same time, you'll have to change one of them to work around the other.
>
>This plugin allows admins to create and delete 'warps' to any planet. They just go on a planet and "/set_warp <name>" to make a warp. It correctly blocks doing so if that name or planet have been used in another warp.
>Similarly, admins can use "/del_warp <name>" to remove warps, and they don't have to be on a planet to do so.
>
>All users can do "/warp" to view a list of set warps, and "/warp <name>" to go to one of the planets free of charge. Currently it starts moving your ship to that planet and instantly warps you down, but I'm looking for a way to keep a player's ship where it is. The plugin has been tested and definitely works the way it should. Also, I suggest protecting a planet before making a warp to it.

## [StarryPy Server Status](https://bitbucket.org/zvorgan/starrypy-server-status/)
>Server status plugin available here. You can send query on specified port (specified in server_status.py) and plugin return status (online/offline) and number of players.
>Also include small php script for embed this in your website.

## [traxo-xx's Notify My Android plugin](https://github.com/StarryPy/StarryPy_plugins/tree/master/plugins/nma_plugin)
> If activated, this plugin will send a notification to your [Notify My Android](https://www.notifymyandroid.com/) account.

> ### Add the following block to your config file:

> ```javascript
        "nma_plugin": {
            "api_application": "StarryPy Server",
            "api_event": "Player joined",
            "api_key": "API_KEY",
            "api_priority": "0",
            "auto_activate": true,
            "ignored_players": [
                "Player"
            ]
        },
>```

> **api_application**: Name of the application the notification will come from.
>
> **api_event**: Subject of the notification.
>
> **ignored_players**: The plugin will not send a notification when a player in this list joins the server.
>
> The other parameters are pretty self-explanatory
